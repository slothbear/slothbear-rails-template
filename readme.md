This template embodies my current standards for a basic Rails application. It is a copy of an app just before I started to add logic specific to the app.

Goal: learn about Rails Application Templates and turn this intoa *real* template.

I started the project with a list of gems common to most of my projects.

Besides the git commit log, I documented trade-offs, workarounds, and other stuff I learned along the way.
